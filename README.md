# Rekaverden

Another spigot plugin for minecraft. Contains block protection, block log, group based block sharing, user management, access managment and more.

Plugin development started in 2016, but because sensitive information was hard-coded in the repo, I decided to wipe the history. Better safe than sorry.

I once lost the original source code, so the code was extracted from a java decompiler.
